What I did:
Got networking/graphics/level loading working on PC and Rasperry Pi
Got input working on Raspberry Pi for keyboard, buttons, joysticks
Built all hardware needed for milestone

How I feel we are doing:
I feel we are on schedule for how we expect to do this semester. Content-wise we met my expectations for the milestone, 
but I would have personally liked to be further along.

I feel we met instructor expectations for where we would be at this point in the semester.
